# File Formats

Different file formats in bioinformatics and what they're used for

## FASTA (.fa)

Raw nucleotide or protein sequence

[Example](../examples/mygene.fasta)

## .fai

Fasta index file generated by `samtools` for fast access to specific regions

[Example hg19 index positions for chromosome positions](../examples/human_g1k_v37.fasta.fai)

## FASTQ (.fq)

FASTA but with quality scores (I think always a [phred quality score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score)?).

Quality score represents probability that the base was called incorrectly by the sequencer

```fastq
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

[Example](../examples/HI.4019.002.index_7.ANN0831_R1.fastq)

## Alignment Formats

### SAM / BAM (Sequence/Binary Alignment Map)

Aligns a sequence with a reference sequence. BAM is the binary format.

[example sam](../examples/toy.sam)

### CRAM (Compressed Reference-oriented Alignment Map)

Compressed Sequence Alignment - more compressed than BAM.

## VCF (Variant Call Format) / BCF (binary format)

Represents sequence variation (e.g. SNPs, indels, structural variants, alternative alleles)

## PDB (protein data bank format)

Representing 3d strucutres of molecules / proteins
