# DNAvigate

DNAvigate is Tom's experimental genome browser, primarily so he can learn about
different file formats / methods in bioinformatics-land.

...but its also because no one has named a genome browser DNAvigate yet? And that seems
like the obvious naming choice???

Please don't expect this to be functional or useful! :)
